## Overview

Developing the back end of the City Explorer API project. 25.07.23 task to create the server.

## Getting Started

Following the steps outlined on my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/xvmgugFQ/ATTIf800f24c118f131ceb9923dfc79a2259CA319B7E/city-explorer), click [HERE](https://trello.com/invite/b/xvmgugFQ/ATTIf800f24c118f131ceb9923dfc79a2259CA319B7E/city-explorer) to view.

## Architecture

This is an exercise developed using REACT in JavaScript and jsx, introducing us to using API's, API keys, .env for storing sensitive information, .gitignore for storing hidden data stores such as the .env file, Query Parameters, Process env, async and await to define when a function executes ensuring a correct sequence, axios (libraries) and tri catch for handling of errors (wrapping the problem code to isolate the problem rather than the error affecting the whole code).
